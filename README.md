## Issue creating rules
1. Make sure there is no issue posted for your game already;
2. You should strictly follow the issue template;
3. Log files are required. Issues without logs will be closed in 24 hrs;
4. Try to provide as much info as possible, this is the key to solving your issue;
5. Your log files should be in FileBin format. You cannot upload said files directly to GitHub, you should compress them into a zip/tar/7z archive and then attach the resulting archive to your issue.
